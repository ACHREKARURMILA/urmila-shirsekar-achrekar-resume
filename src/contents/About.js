            <p>I started my journey as a fine artist ,Pursuing my master of fine arts Degree in
            Sir J.J. School of arts,Mumbai.After completing post graduation in fine arts,due to keen 
            interest in graphic and web designing I started learning graphic and web designing.
            I am equally happy working across both print and digital media. I have a solid and up-to-date
            understanding of user experience in web design combined with coding knowledge which enables
            me to design & build effective, original and user-friendly responsive websites. I also like
            creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those design and codes
            to the world through Github.
